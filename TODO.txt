* See to have clients and servers for HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2/HTTP3
  (we already have such in libsnapwebsites, only it uses `snapuri`...)

* Config describing allowed messages with their parameters and values for
  such and a way to track which message was ever sent (i.e. a form of
  message coverage) so we can verify that all messages were checked
  (i.e. for debug purposes).

* A service to track changes to the list of opened/closed network connections
  (I already have code to do that, but I never spent any time on implementing
  anything in link with it. It should track the changes to the /proc/... file
  and report these through some mechanism similar to the file_change system).

* Finish the snaplogger network appender extension.

* Add a function used to print the list of existing connections.
  This is quite useful when trying to quit and some connections were not
  properly removed from the list. That list could be printed by the
  remove_connection() function or the run() function once a given flag
  is set to true. That way we can make it easy on the users of the library.

* Consider moving the cppprocess tee_pipe to eventdispatcher.
