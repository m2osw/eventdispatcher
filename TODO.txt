* See to have clients and servers for HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2
  (we already have such in libsnapwebsites, only it uses `snapuri`...)

* Config describing allowed messages with their parameters and values for
  such and a way to track which message was ever sent (i.e. a form of
  message coverage) so we can verify that all messages were checked
  (i.e. for debug purposes).

* A service to track changes to the list of opened/closed network connections
  (I already have code to do that, but I never spent any time on implementing
  anything in link with it. It should track the changes to the /proc/... file
  and report these through some mechanism similar to the file_change system).

* Finish the snaplogger network appender extension.
