 * \li `reason=config` -- a configuration file was updated

 * available. Now that we have the fluid-settings service, that changed
 * and in most cases, `reason=config` should not be necessary anymore.
 * (only for fluid-settings itself and for some parameters not found
 * in the fluid-settings).
 *
 * \note
 * There are currently some services that make use of a CONFIG message
 * whenever their configuration changes. Pretty much all services do
 * not support a live configuration change (because it initializes their
 * objects from the configuration data once on startup and in many cases
 * it would be very complicated to allow for changes to occur on the fly).
 * \note
 * In those existing implementations, we really just do a restart anyway.
 * \note
 * New versions will be using fluid-settings. We can still support
 * a RESTART message, but a RELOADCONFIG (as we had in the communicator
 * daemon) should not be used.

 *
 * This function gathers the list of commands this connection understands.
 * It then sends that list the communicator daemon.
 *
 * It is expected that the communicator daemon only accumulate the
 * command names. This is important since
 *
 * 1. some services make use of fully dynamic commands, which get
 *    added only at the time it becomes necessary. For example,
 *    the cluck service adds a few commands such as LOCKED and
 *    LOCK_FAILED;
 * 2. the messages may travel via UDP which does not guarantee
 *    the order in which the messages will be delivered.
 *
 * \warning
 * The \p msg parameter must be the HELP message from the communicator
 * daemon. The function verifies such.
 *
 * \param[in] msg  The message we are replying to or nullptr.
