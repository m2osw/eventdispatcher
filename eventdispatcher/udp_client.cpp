/** \brief Initialize a UDP client object.
 *
 * This function initializes the UDP client object using the address and the
 * port as specified.
 *
 * The port is expected to be a host side port number (i.e. 59200).
 *
 * The \p addr parameter is a textual address. It may be an IPv4 or IPv6
 * address and it can represent a host name or an address defined with
 * just numbers. If the address cannot be resolved then an error occurs
 * and the constructor throws.
 *
 * \note
 * The socket is open in this process. If you fork() or exec() then the
 * socket will be closed by the operating system.
 *
 * \warning
 * We only make use of the first address found by getaddrinfo(). All
 * the other addresses are ignored.
 *
 * \exception udp_client_server_runtime_error
 * The server could not be initialized properly. Either the address cannot be
 * resolved, the port is incompatible or not available, or the socket could
 * not be created.
 *
 * \param[in] addr  The address to convert to a numeric IP.
 * \param[in] port  The port number.
 * \param[in] family  The family used to search for 'addr'.

 * the udp_client object.
 *
 * The size must be small enough for the message to fit. In most cases, we
 * use these in Snap! to send very small signals (i.e. 4 bytes commands.)
 * Any data we would want to share remains in the Cassandra database so
 * that way we can avoid losing it because of a UDP message.
 *
 * \param[in] msg  The message to send.
 * \param[in] size  The number of bytes representing this message.
 *
 * \return -1 if an error occurs, otherwise the number of bytes sent. errno
 * is set accordingly on error.
