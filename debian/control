Package: reporter
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Suggests: eventdispatcher-doc
Depends: eventdispatcher-dev (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: SnapCatch2 extension for the C++ Event Dispatcher library.
 This library and headers provide support to create unit tests that actually
 create network connections and send messages as in the real world allowing
 you to debug your services before they hit production.

Package: cppprocess
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: eventdispatcher (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: Run processes with pipes in and out.
 This library is capable of running processes like a Unix shell. It starts
 them with a pipe as input and a pipe as output to send and collect data
 and it supports piping between multiple processes.

Package: cppprocess-dev
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: cppprocess (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: Run processes with pipes in and out.
 This is the cppprocess development library and headers.

Package: cppprocess-doc
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Suggests: cppprocess
Description: Documentation about the cppprocess with pipes in and out.
 This is the cppprocess documentation.

Package: snaplogger-network
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: eventdispatcher (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++ library to extend the logger to the network
 This library offers a TCP and a UDP appender to be able to send the snaplogger
 output to other computers via the network.

Package: snaplogger-network-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Suggests: snaplogger-network-doc
Depends: snaplogger-network (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++ library to extend the logger to the network
 This library offers a TCP and a UDP appender to be able to send the snaplogger
 output to other computers via the network. This includes the development
 files (headers, library to link against).

Package: snaplogger-network-doc
Section: doc
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++ library to extend the logger to the network
 This package includes the documentation of the C++ library extension to
 offer network capabilities in the snaplogger project.

Package: snaploggerd
Section: utils
Architecture: any
Depends: eventdispatcher (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: Daemon to collect logs on a remote computer
 This service is expected to be installed on one computer that will then
 automatically receive logs from other computer. This is an extension to
 the snaplogger package, which only saves logs locally.

Package: snaplogger-utils
Section: utils
Architecture: any
Depends: eventdispatcher (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: Command line tool to send log messages from scripts.
 The snaplog command line tool is expected to be used to send messages from
 a console or a script. It simulates the snaplogger message() function.
 You can specify all the message fields from the command line (filename,
 line from which the message was generated, component name, additional
 "field-name=value", etc.) This tool can be used to send messages to a
 snaplogger supporting the snaplogger-network plugin.
