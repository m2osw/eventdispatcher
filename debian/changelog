  * Added the ed-signal tool.
  * Added a corresponding configuration file.
  * Fixed some of the dispatcher and other documentation.
  * Added a restart() function for the RESTART message (instead of using
    ready() which is for another message)
  * Renamed the variables of the connection_with_send_message() to avoid the
    shadowing of the message class.

eventdispatcher (1.1.14.0~bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * We are actually using the tcp_bio_server so the close-on-exec needs to be
    in that class as well (the tcp_server may actually be removed at some
    point since it pretty much a duplicate of the tcp_biod_server).
  * Also allow changing the keepalive flag.
